            <h2>Learning Plan</h2>
            <p></p>
            <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
            <p>My plan is to become a web developer and work for someone else for a couple of years before I go freelance. Due to the nature of my previous career, I really value the ability of being flexible with my time for myself, my family and my friends.</p>
            
            <h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h3>
            <p>I have written them out in detail <a href="identity-values.html#strengths-limitations">here</a>. I am able to stay focused for long periods of time when I am learning something that is of interest to me. This can also be one of my limitations due to my ‘perfectionist’ nature for wanting my work to look a certain way. This usually leads me down a rabbit hole and then I end up spending too much time on it!</p>

            <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
            <p>The main one I want to develop further is my communication. I’d like to develop my ability to communicate clearly and effectively without feeling worried about offending the other person. I know I do this very often and sometimes I end up not saying what I really wanted to say. I’d like to practise more active listening and reframing it back to the speaker to prevent miscommunication.</p>
            
            <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h3>
            <p>To mange work productivity, I will ensure I take short breaks every 30mins-1hour depending on my focus level. This means getting up and moving around or even just going out to stare out the window just as a way for my brain and my eyes to take a break from the screen. I will put away my phone so I am not distracted and I will put on some background music as I found this helps me with my focus.<p>
            <p>In terms of working safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives, I am hoping to develop my active listening and referring back to ensure that I am communicating effectively and that we’re all on the same page.</p>
            <p> When things are building up and is getting to me, I plan to stop and take a break away from the situation or the person to allow myself time to process what happened. This could include going out for a short walk or moving to a different room.<p>

            <h3>How and where I will seek help in a timely way</h3>
            <p>When I notice I am getting stuck and I’m beginning go get frustrated, I will give myself a 5 minute break away and come back to see if I can figure it out. I will give myself 10-15minutes to try and if I really can’t and am getting frustrated again, I will ask either on Slack or ask my facilitator. </p>

            <h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3>
            <p>To provide support and help lead me in the right direction when I am going down a rabbit hole or when I am just going in the wrong direction. I find examples/live demonstrations and feedback valuable and helps me progress in my learning. I also really value when people take time to explain something to help me deepen my understanding.</p>

            <h3>Scheduling commitments</h3>
            <p> I currently am quite flexible with my time. I have decided that I won’t do any work in the weekends (unless I really need to for catchups) to give myself a break from the workload.<p>
