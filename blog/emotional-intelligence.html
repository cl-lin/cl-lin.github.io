        <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>
          <p>Emotional Intelligence is a person’s ability to empathise/relate to others in social situations and the ability to self regulate, and understand their emotions.</p>
          <p>To me, I think emotional intelligence is really important because it has a big affect on a person’s well-being especially in our current climate where people anxious and stressed on a daily basis. If we take more time to learn ‘human skills’ like regulating emotions and relating to others, it could help elevate stress and there would be less conflicts between people. </p>
          <p>I believe that a person’s emotional intelligence can be improved upon. When I was reading the articles I have listed below, it made me think of the students I’ve taught at school. To me, developing emotional intelligence was (and still is) really important skill for children to have and so I heavily focused on teaching them the basic skills to recognise different emotions and ways to manage anxiety and conflict.</p>
          <p>I’m really glad that there is a big focus on the human skill side in Dev Academy and that was what ultimately what drew me into taking this course. </p>
