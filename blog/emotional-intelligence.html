      <h2>EQ vs EQ<h2>

        <h3> What is EQ and IQ and how are they different??</h3>
        
        <p>IQ (Intelligence Quotient) is the measure of a person’s ability to learn information and utilise it to solve problems or make predictions in a logical way. While it widely used to determine how ‘smart’ someone is, the downfall with with IQ tests is that it does not factor in other thinking abilities we possess.</p>
        <p>EQ (Emotional Quotient) or emotional intelligence is the measure of a person’s ability to empathise/relate to others in social situations and the ability to self regulate, and understand their emotions. EQ describes a different set of thinking skills that relate to understanding oneself and creating meaningful interactions with others. </p>

        <h3> Why is Emotional Intelligence important and why is it relevant to me?</h3>
        
        <p> Having high emotional intelligence is now well regarded and has been linked to job successes and building positive relationships. Having a high EQ means that the person is able to work well with different people in a rapidly changing environment that occur in our daily lives.</p>
        <p>I think emotional intelligence is really important because it has a big affect on a person’s well-being especially in our current climate where people are anxious and stressed on a daily basis. If we learn to regulate our emotions and relate well to others, it could help elevate stress/anxiety and there would be less conflicts and misunderstandings between people.</p>
